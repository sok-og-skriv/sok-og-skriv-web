# Textual analysis

In order to establish more accurately whether the source is relevant to your dissertation, you should analyse the text to find out a) how it is written, and b) what objectives the author had in writing precisely this text.

There are three reasons for writing a scholarly text:

1. To investigate a topic
2. To analyse a problem
3. To communicate research materials or results

Our discussion here focuses on point 3. How are the results communicated?

Firstly, textual analysis is primarily concerned with establishing what it was that the author wished to communicate to you, the reader. Secondly, you should establish how the author communicated her or his results by examining her or his use of rhetorical devices. Finally, the textual analysis will enable you to understand the scholarly contexts within which the author has developed her or his text. How does the text relate to other texts?

## What does the author wish to communicate?

- What does the author find in her or his material?
- What is the point of her or his argument?
- What materials is the author basing her or his argument on? What types of empirical data form the basis of her or his argument?
- Does the author have adequate theoretical and empirical documentation to substantiate her or his claims?
- Does the author highlight anything in her or his material that is of particularly key importance to the arguments she or he presents?
- What perspective does she or he adopt?
- How can you use these results in your dissertation?

## How are rhetorical devices used in the text?

- How does the author attempt to convince you that her or his perspective is worthwhile?
- If relevant, how does she or he convince you to ignore other perspectives or weaknesses in her or his presentation?
- What devices does the author use to hold you attention?
- How does the author arouse the reader’s interest? Which examples does the author choose to expand upon? Are they amusing? Disturbing? Informative?
- What is the author’s attitude to the material she or he is presenting? How does the author make the reader feel “included”? Is the author’s enthusiasm infectious? Is the tone didactic? Does the author give an authoritative impression?

## How does the text relate to other texts?

Look at the text in the light of other texts: Ask the following questions:

- Does the text offer an answer? If so, to what? Does it pose a challenge?
- Does the text display the influence of other texts produced at the same time?
