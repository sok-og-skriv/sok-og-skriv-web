# Why cite sources?

High-quality academic work is based on conscious use of key scholarly sources, and  builds on existing knowledge. Your references will reflect the scope of your work. They are also evidence of your integrity in using other people’s work. For these reasons, referencing is one of the factors that will be taken into consideration when your thesis is graded.

Accurate referencing allows the reader to quickly:

- retrieve the sources you have used
- check your facts and verify your results
- become better acquainted with the topic

## Avoiding plagiarism

Make sure to cite your sources accurately in order to avoid accusations of plagiarism. Plagiarism means presenting other people’s results, thinking, ideas or formulations as your own. Plagiarism is considered intellectual theft under the Norwegian [Copyright Act](https://lovdata.no/lov/2018-06-15-40) and also to constitute cheating.

Pursuant to Sections 4-7 and 4-8 of the Norwegian [Universities and University Colleges Act](https://www.lovdata.no/all/nl-20050401-015.html), plagiarism is grounds for examination failure and expulsion. An allegation of plagiarism may also delay your academic progress. This in turn may affect your eligibility for a student loan or (if you are a foreign student) renewal of your visa.

All higher educational institutions are alert to plagiarism and many use plagiarism-detection software.

## Supervisors and other people who have provided assistance

In addition to referencing your written sources, it is considered good practice to mention everyone who has assisted you with your thesis. As well as supervisors, remember to mention any people or institutions who have contributed ideas, funding or equipment. These should be mentioned at the beginning of your thesis, preferably in your preface and not in the references.
