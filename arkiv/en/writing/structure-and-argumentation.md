# Structure and argumentation

The structure of your text is the “skeleton” that holds the various elements together - in the right order. In order to ensure that your text is properly structured and flows well, it is important to understand the function of the different chapters. In a thesis, everything you write has to have a purpose. In this section you will find advice about what the different chapters should include, and what functions they are meant to serve.

In a good thesis:

- All questions raised by the author are answered or clarified
- The author’s intention is clear to the reader at all times
- Everything that is presented, fills a purpose
- The theory presented is put to work
- The methods section is concrete
- The discussion brings together empirical data, theory and method
- The findings are duly presented
- The conclusion follows logically from the argumentation

There are many different ways to structure a thesis. While the [IMRaD](/en/writing/the-imrad-format/) format is widely used in health care and the natural sciences, formats are more flexible in the social sciences and humanities.

There are many excellent publications on thesis writing.
