# A digital toolbox for academic writing

Here you can find articles on [writing](/en/writing/) and [reading](/en/reading/), and you can look up [reference styles](/en/sources-and-references/reference-styles/) and other [formal requirements](/en/writing/formal-requirements/). Experienced academics share their top tips in our videos (see below).

We have also made three short films about [basic search techniques](/en/searching/searching-techniques/) that can be used for both teaching and consultation.

Have a great semester!
