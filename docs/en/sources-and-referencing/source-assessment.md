# Source assessment

When considering which source to use, there are several things to consider. You should consider the source type, credibility and authority. Questions about the quality of the source can be decided on the basis of questions of what the content was produced for, what references the source uses, the origin of the source, and when the source was published. Source assessment means that the source is evaluated by type, authenticity, credibility and authority. You can also figure out the quality of the source by asking questions about what the content was produced for, what references it used, its origin and publication date

Assessing and reflecting sources can often be much the same as assessing the content of an article. See Reading Modes for how help with evaluating the content of a article.

Based on your assessments, you can decide whether the source is useful and rightfor what youre working on. On the previous page, we considered the type of source that was best for which purpose, here we are going to consider the contents of the source. There are several steps that can help you to evaluate the source.

## The Author

All sources should be assessed based on the professional background of the author. Is he / she an expert in the field, or do they have a different background? You should confirm this before using the source in your assignment. When you have a recent source, you can investigate whether: 

* The author has written other articles on the same topic. Feel free to search the author in Oria, Google or other databases.
* You can look up articles and books that are referenced in the text. Look through the reference list at the end of the article. Are these relevant to you?
* Citation search is useful for finding out who has referenced the paper in recent research. Citation searches can be done in the Web of Science database
* Do you want to check who has quoted a particular work by another author? You can search for a combination of author and work (journal title or book title abbreviated), or the year when the work was published.

## Sources within the text

Make sure to look at the reference list for the text you read. They show what sources the author has used in their text, in other words the kind of information the author bases their arguments and conclusions on. Consider the extent to which the author substantiates their claims by using empirical information, theory and method.

* To what extent does the author refer to other sources?
* Who does the author refer to?
* Are the sources accurate?

## Audience and Genre

It is important to think about who the source has been for. All text is written for a reader, and who that intended reader is shapes the text. One way to identify the text’s target audience is by analyzing the text’s genre – what kind of source is it that you are working with?

Publishers

The publisher may have influenced the material you are working with. This might happen because the publisher wants to promote their own interests, or try and appeal to a certain audience. In many cases, it is quite simple to find out who is the publisher. If it is a book, you will usually find the publisher’s name on the front or back of the title page. It may be a more less known publisher. Sometimes it can be difficult to find out who has published the material. If the publisher is unknown to you, it is even more important to find out more about who the publisher is, and here are some suggestions in helping you find that information.

* Look for the publishers name
* Search in Oria, Google, or another search engine to try and get a sense of what types of text the publisher is publishing.
* Look for a review about the publisher
* Look for a list of editors who reviewed the text before publishing.
* Try and get an idea of what they are interested in publishing, and what topics they usually focus on. -- If the source is a journal, examine what their peer review process looks like.

## Date of Publication

The date of publication is often relevant information. Often we are looking for recent and up-to-date sources that provide the latest knowledge and information. To help ensure this, you should obtain the latest edition of a book, if it has appeared in several editions. Other times we might be looking for older information. This could be information published within a specific historical period, or within a certain time frame of years

## When was the source produced?

* Look for the date of publication by looking at the book’s publishing page (usually on back side of the title page)
* Look for what edition it is. Is this a new and revised edition of an earlier edition?
* Examine the dates of the sources that the book uses
* If you are using online sources, check when the information was published or last updated.
* Evaluate the date of the source, and how relevant it is to your assignment

## Text Analysis

To be able to know more if the source is relevant for your assignment, you will need to analyze the text to find out why it was written and what was the authors purpose in writing the text. You should look specifically at how the author conveys the material and results.

It is important to figure out what the author wants to convey to you as a reader. You should also look at what rhetoric the author uses in communicating their results. The text analysis allows you to assess and compare the professionality of the text, and answer some important questions about the text quality. How does the text compare to other texts? How is the language of the text?

* What findings does the researcher make from their material?
* What material is the research based on? What empirical data is used?
* Does the researcher have sufficient theoretical and empirical evidence for the claims they make?
* What material does the researcher make central for the arguments that they put forward?
* Which professional prospective do they take?
* How can you use their results in your assignment?

## Use of rhetoric in the text

* How does the author convince the reader that their perspective is valid?
* How do they ignore other perspectives or weaknesses in their presentation
* What does the author do to hold your attention?
* How do you become an engaged reader? What examples does the author present? Are they fun examples? Ones filled with anxious or enlightening messages?
* What attitude does the author present in the text? How are you are as a reader included? How does their message spread to the reader? what is their tone that is used in the text?
