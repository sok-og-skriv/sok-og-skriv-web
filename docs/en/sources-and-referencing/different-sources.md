# Different sources

According to the [Large Norwegian Lexicon](https://snl.no), a source is a place where someone can receive information and knowledge on a topic.  In other words sources can be found in many different places: online, books, articles, etc.   

## What is the purpose of sources? 

When you are looking up information for your assignment you will encounter information that is presented in many different ways and in different formats.  Writing an assignment is partially about knowing which sources and information will be the most useful for your assignment.  Each source has its own purpose and role.  In many cases the types of sources we use will be those that follow our academic genre and help build up our reasoning and overall strength of the assignment.  Other times sources will be laws that we are referencing, or definitions from encyclopedias.  What source you use will depend on the information you need for your assignment, and what are the points you are trying to make.  To write an academic text it is necessary to think about types of sources are needed for the assignment.   

## Articles 

An article has a variety of formats, and could be an article in a journal,or one that is published in a newspaper or online, including on NRK, VG, etc.  Always assess what type of article it is that you have in front of you.  For example, if it is an article published in a journal, you will see the name of the journal (journal of.. For example) and a DOI number (an article’s unique URL).  Many articles (especially those which are published in journals and that don’t have popular science content) have a high level of quality content that help make your arguments stronger.  Feel free to base your assignment on articles after you have reviewed them thoroughly.  Even if you read the articles on the internet, they will still always be referenced to their journal that they come from.   


## Scientific article  

A scientific article is a text where an author writes about a specific subject or case.  The author will provide a judgment on a specific case or will make an argument about a specific point of view.  The article must present new insights, and be verifiable or useful for new research.  The scientific article is used by researchers to disseminate research results with and across the scientific community. 


## Overview / Review Article  

An overview article is a research article that provides an overview and background of a research topic by presenting relevant research literature.  The article provides a summary, analysis, and conclusion on a research questions, and is intended to help researchers gain and understanding and orient themselves within the field of research.   


## Subject or research article? 

Especially in the medical field it is common to distinguish between subject and research articles, and in many assignments it is expected that the student will be able to make a distinction between the two.  In addition as a student it will be expected that you will know when it is more appropriate to use research article vs an academic article.   


According to [sykepleien.no](https://sykepleien.no) a research article is meant to present new research, while a subject article summarizes knowledge that is already known.  Since a research article is presenting new results that must be verifiable, a research article must be transparent and explain process for how the researchers arrived at their findings.   

When you are trying to determine if it is a subject or research article you are looking at, consider whether the article is presenting new research and findings or is instead summarizing previous research.  It can also be helpful to look at their methods chapter, and see if they have detailed it enough so that you could replicate their research process.   


## Professional Peer Review 

Professional peer review means that an article has been reviewed by at least two professionals within the same field of research before being accepted for publication.  The authors of the article receive feedback and suggestions for improvements that must be made before the article can be published.  This helps to ensure that articles meet a certain level of quality.  This also helps to ensure that the articles follows the academic and scientific guidelines of their specific field.  Edits must be applied before the article can be published.   

Always consider the source both for peer-reviewed articles and articles published in other journals. Articles that are not peer reviewed can still be relevant and good.   

## Popular science article  

The popular science article, like the scientific article, conveys insights and findings from new research.  What is different here is that the popular science article’s goal is to communicate this information beyond the scientific research community.  The goal is to convey the findings to a “more general audience”.  Popular science articles often use language that is similar to that in journalism.  You can find examples of this on the website illustrated science.  The level of verifiability is slightly less than you would find in a scientific article.  This eases the requirement of stating your empirics and other in-depth aspects of your methods.  Similar to the essay, the use of metaphors are common in popular science articles.   


## Essay 

The essay is a personalized form of an article.  It is clearly shaped by the authors, and often contains their opinions and attitudes.  The author can use personal experiences, anecdotes, or methaphors as illustrative examples.  It is often written with the intention to entertain and can be presented in a more approachable language.  The essay falls into a genre of writing between subject or prose based writing.   

## Textbook 

A textbook is a reference book for students to be to give an overview of a subject and the current discourse surrounding it. A textbook often includes current theories as well as a short history of the subject. The aim of a textbook is often to include students in the academic community. Importantly, a textbook does not necessarily discuss “The most important” topics in the subject, but rather represent the theories that the author decides are most important to them as the expert.  


## Thesis 


A thesis is a longer work that is limited to a topic or idea within a subject normally a master's thesis or a doctoral dissertation. There are specific requirements for these papers which concern adding to a previous body of research as such the academic community has strict expectations. 

Bachelor theses and other smaller student papers are often sources you should only use for inspiration rather than what you can write about yourself, to obtain an overview of relevant literature or to see what layout and structure you want to have. 


## Online resources  

There are many different relevant websites that can be used as sources and to find information on a given topic. Google is a good place to quickly find information you need. News sites offer  the latest news and it can be helpful to see how your topic is covered in the media. You can also find great quotes on different sites relevant to your field. By using the internet as a source of knowledge you can equip yourself with a variety of sources.  The internet is a very important source to consider, and you can find relevant reputable information.  However, there is a lot of information online and many sites wont be ideal academic sources. 

Encyclopedia vs Wikipedia 

Encyclopedias contain trustworthy, reputable information and background material on a variety of topics. The articles are compiled by subject editors and experts across a range of subjects and utilize reference lists. Encyclopedias are available in printed and electronic editions. 


Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia that is created and edited by anyone who chooses to. Feel free to use Wikipedia as a starting point to get an overview of a topic, to check what sources they use, or to read up on the topic. The basic rule is that you should never use Wikipedia as your sole source, but you can use it a place to compare perspectives against other pages. You should make sure to check what you find in Wikipedia against reputable academic sources. 


::: tip Handy tip! 
There are now subject-specific encyclopedias such as the Large Medical Encyclopedia which are offer detailed information within a specific field. 
  
Encyclopedias are good sources to use when defining phrases, words and phrases. Or to look up a short, common topic. For example, they can be useful to search for definitions on nursing, technology or business economics.

## Blogs 

A blog can be an easy way to check out discussions in different forums. You can subscribe to blogs like RSS feeds. Be aware that the style of a blog can often be in diary form and discuss the writer´s personal experiences or opinions. They are not always based on verifiable and scientifically documented claims.   

::: tip Handy tip! 

Check to see if there are any professional blogs in the area you're researching. For example, see the blog Forskning.no.

## Chronicles 

A chronicle is a relatively short article about an enlightening or reasoning character, usually in a newspaper and written by someone who is not included in the newspaper. Chronicles are often used by researchers to bring research-based knowledge into the public. Chronicles, just like encyclopedias and Wikipedia, can be a good place to start to get an overview of a given topic and can help to give you a better understanding of the topic. 

## News

News broadcasters and other sites that report the latest news may be useful for getting a perspective on how their topic is addressed. Note that, in the same way as chronicles, popular science and essays, news reports are not academic papers and should be avoided as part of argumentation and discussion. 


## Other Sources 

There are many sources other than those mentioned above that can be helpful. 
 

## Radio and TV programs 

Radio or TV programs can also be a good place to get fresh angles for your assignment. If you are going to write about psychiatry but are unsure of what angle you want, it may be helpful to listen to the podcast "LEGG INN" or to watch the documentary series "LEGG INN" Or if you are writing about other topics within society, health or the environment, there are plenty of Norwegian and international programs that can help you get ideas and inspiration. 

::: warning NB 

If you want to use radio or TV programs as a source, shorter clips can be used without special permission, but for longer clips you must contact the filmmaker or producer to avoid misinterpretations of meaning.

## Pictures from the Internet, photography, illustrations, picture-art  

Pictures, illustrations and picture-art all might be useful for the task you are working with.  This might be true for both professional and more personal tasks as well.  For example, you may have a friend or family member who is an artist and has made a painting or drawing that helps to illustrate a topic or concept from your assignment.  Or you may write about how art can be used in a pedagogical approach or as a form of expression in psychiatry.  Here it may be useful to include pictures to support a point you are making in your text.  It is important to remember that many pictures, photographers, and illustrations are not always available to use in your task without paying for them or having received permission.  The ones you can freely use are usually found in Creative Commons. 


## Fieldwork and other observational studies 

In different fields and subjects where participant observation is useful as a method, informants are often an important source.  Odd Are Berkaak, a professor in social anthropology at UiO, describes in a video about how to write about your informants in your text.
