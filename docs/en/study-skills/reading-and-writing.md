# Reading and writing

The purpose of written assignments in higher education is to develop your own independent written work based on what you have read and learned. One way to create your own text is by restructuring elements from texts written by others and disussing arguments presented in other texts. Reading while writing implies reading from the perspective of a research question and actively using what you read to develop your own analyses and argumentation. Through the reading process, you collect material that you can use in your own writing.

Keep in mind that the material you use is taken out of its original context. When you refer to or cite another text, you make it your own. You are responsible for everything in your own text. However, you cannot simply appropriate other people’s thoughts and writings as if they were your own. You need to distinguish clearly between your own ideas, paraphrases (indirect quotations) and direct quotations. In other words, you need to master basic [citation techniques](/en/sources-and-referencing/how-to-cite.html).


## How to take good notes

While reading a text, you sometimes think: "That was interesting, I didn't know that, I have to remember that." How can you take these glimpses of insight with you further in your studies? There is note-taking, and other ways you can combine reading and writing in your work. 

Writing keywords, highlighting and underlining a text is a technique you can use to become a more active reader. But be aware that a text full of underlinings can give the false impression that you have worked more thoroughly with the text than you actually have. Underlining is easy; extracting important information and important points and arranging the material in your own notes is more difficult - but in return it gives greater dividends. 

Write notes on what you read in a separate document. This will automatically make you write better and more informative notes than if you just take notes in the text itself. Feel free to make short summaries of what you read. 

Grasp the text's main message, argumentation, and the context in which the text exists. Feel free to wait with underlining and making notes until you have read through the text, or until you have read enough to understand the direction the text is taking and what it is about. (More about this under [Ways of reading](/en/ways-of-reading.md)). If you fixate too much on details, you may find that it becomes more difficult to grasp the whole of the text. Note places in the text where the author gathers his arguments or where the main points are most clearly expressed. 

Decide which characters you use to mark what with. Dashes, double dashes, circles around specific terms, exclamation marks or crosses are examples of characters that can be used to highlight the text. When you bring up the text again, it is quicker to spot the most important thing.

Consider:

What you perceive as most important can change. The first time you work on a difficult text on a new topic, you may find yourself guessing quite a bit about what is important in the text. It is not certain that you will guess correctly in the first instance. Be open to the fact that you may have overlooked something important, perhaps even the most important thing.

During the writing process, you may find it useful to go back and read a text again, because your perspective may have changed. Maybe you understand the argument better after reading something else? Perhaps the process of deliberating has made you ask other questions? Perhaps you can benefit from the text in a different way than you first thought, because you have changed your research question?

## Writing a summary

The idea of writing summaries while reading is to provide a tool for repetition. Highlight the main features of the text’s argumentation and structure. Your summary should be [accurate and true](/en/sources-and-referencing/how-to-cite.html "How to cite") to the text in question. Present the issues and arguments contained in a text on the text’s own premises. A summary should be neutral – this is not the place to apply your own research questions to the contents of the text or to criticise it - but you should not refrain from rephrasing and putting things in your own words. When writing summaries, aim to reproduce the authors' claims and arguments in such a way that they might say: “Yes, that was what I meant.”

Writing summaries can be demanding, but they are very useful when you have to write long assignments or reports, and in teaching and academic discussions, as there may be texts you must return to after a gap of time.

## Read, and share

When writing a thesis, it is important to read it through several times. Be critical, and ask your own text the same questions you would ask other texts: What is the point I want to make here? Is the research question clear? Does the text provide an answer?

As with other texts, it is often a good idea to put the text aside for a while occationally, and then return to it to look it over with fresh eyes. Is anything unclear? Is it entirely clear to the reader what I am investigating, what I want to demonstrate and/or argue, which ideas are my own and which are those of other scholars, and so on?

Read your text out loud. This will help you discover problems your readers might encounter. Are the sentences too long? Is the text repetitive? One can easily get lost in details when looking at one’s own text; hearing how it sounds may give you ideas for improvements.

Let other people read and comment on your text. Why not ask both fellow students and someone who is not familiar with your discipline? They might discover ambiguities that you are not aware of. When you and your fellow students read each other’s texts, you learn and find inspiration, and you may also become aware of weaknesses and mistakes in other texts that you want to avoid in your own. Thus, swapping texts can be useful for both reader and writer.


## Academic genres

When studying, you have to read different types of texts: textbooks, reference works, scholarly and popular articles and essays, conference papers, official reports and theses.

In other words, the texts you read belong to different genres. Being conscious of genres will aid your understanding and interpretation of a text. Genre is also a useful concept when writing - look for inspiration in the texts you have read. If you are writing a term paper, bachelor’s thesis or home examination, the text should be more like an article than a textbook chapter. That is, the text should consist of arguments and discussion, rather than simply present factual knowledge.

In school one learns about literary genres (poems, short stories, novels, plays, etc.) and non-fiction genres. There are both scholarly and non-scholarly genres within non-fiction. Non-scholarly examples are journalistic texts, such as editorials and news reports. The following section describes some genres of academic writing and outlines their particular characteristics.

### Textbook

A textbook is mean to communicate established knowledge to students of a given subject. It provides a general introduction to the subject as well as relevant problems, concepts and theories. A textbook presents knowledge, and explains how it has been and can be used. It informs and instructs. Even though a textbook can include discussion and argumentation, its primary objective is not to argue for or against particular positions, but to present the existing views within the subject.

### Scholarly article 

The purpose of a scholarly article is to present new knowledge or to provide new perspectives on an academic or scientific problem or object. The target audience is other scholars. A scholarly article is primarily argumentative. It claims that something is true or probably true, and presents arguments to support the claim. Hence, a scholarly article has to present thorough and consistent reasoning. The reasoning must be properly substantiated, through references to empirical data or other research. Authors of scholarly articles should use acknowledged research methods and explain them.

### Thesis

A thesis is a major piece of scholarly work. In some fields (especially medicine and the natural sciences), theses are frequently assembled from existing (published) articles. The thesis will then include an introduction that explains how the different articles are related to the overall theme of the thesis. In other fields (in particular the humanities and social sciences), a thesis is often a monograph, that is, a continuous text divided into chapters. In either case, a thesis is similar to a scholarly research paper in that it presents new knowledge to other professionals in the field, puts forward arguments, and is thoroughly substantiated. If you are writing a master’s thesis, this is the type of text you should aim to produce.

### Popular (non-scholarly) work

"Popular" texts, in the form of either books or articles, are intended to communicate established knowledge to the “general reader”. Since such texts generally do not attempt to establish new knowledge or challenge accepted truths, there will normally be less argumentation than in a scholarly text. The author instead tries to bring the subject to life by devices such as stories, anecdotes and illustrations. Sometimes the whole text is constructed as a narrative, for example in the form of a biography of a leading expert, or by recounting historical events.

### Encyclopaedia article

The purpose of an encyclopaedia article is to present established knowledge neutrally, concisely and clearly. The target audience is usually general readers, as well as specialists, although there are also scholarly encyclopaedias that require the reader to have specialist knowledge. Encyclopaedia articles are not generally intended to persuade the reader by way of reasoned argument, and they do not clarify or instruct as a textbook would. Encyclopaedia articles are intended primarily to be informative and descriptive. They provide information, define words and concepts, and describe relevant circumstances.

## More about genres – and a bit about speech acts

After reading the descriptions of academic genres above, consider the following:

- The assignment of genre to a text is a rough classification by characteristics and context. The very act of classification, however, is also a genre, and its utility varies with the intended purpose. The classification outlined above serves to offer some basic guidelines.
- In practice, the above genres are not always completely strict or isolated. We often encounter texts that _combine_ genres or _breach_ the conventions of specific genres. A biography can have both popular and scholarly elements, and should perhaps be referred to as a “scholarly biography”. A given article might be more inquisitive, argumentative, personal and linguistically original than a standard scholarly research paper, and is perhaps better described as an _essay_. In this area there are often differences both in terminology and between professional traditions.

In the summary above, we distinguish between genres by _purpose_ and _target audience_. We also use a number of words (verbs) to describe the different genres, or what texts in these genres _do:_ communicate, explain, present, argue, inform, describe, narrate, and so on. A genre of writing can be said to be characterised by the dominance of one or more speech acts. The _primary purpose_ of an encyclopaedia article is to inform the reader. The _primary purpose_ of a scholarly article is to present arguments. This does not mean that the article cannot _also_ be informative. The provision of information, however, is subordinate to argumentation.

When reading an academic text, we can try to identify the different _speech acts_. Language researchers (linguists) sometimes talk about different “text types”. A common classification scheme (which derives from 19th century American teaching of rhetoric and writing) uses four “modes of discourse”: exposition (i.e., the presentation of an idea and relevant evidence), description, narration and argumentation, abbreviated to the acronym EDNA.

When reading a text, you should ask the following questions. What is the text doing now? Is it explaining? Is it describing? Is it narrating? Is it arguing? By asking these questions, you will deepen your understanding of what is going on in the text. Such a reading will also actively prepare you for your own writing.
