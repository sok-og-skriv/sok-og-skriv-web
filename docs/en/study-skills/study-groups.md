# Study groups

Discussing texts with others is a good way to engage actively with a text.Â You are likely to read more attentively if you are planning to discuss the text. Discussions also let you practise applying concepts and articulating arguments.

Efficient groupwork needs planning: Plan in advance; agree on a topic and text(s) to discuss, and assign different texts or portions of text to different members of the group. Each person is responsible for presenting their material to the rest of the group. By taking turns, all group members will practice oral skills such as presenting, explaining and commenting relevant material. Even though unstructured group work can also be rewarding, they are less likely to edure in the long run. 

Forming a group early in your studies will give you a kickstart. You may begin to read and discuss course readings. Once you start writing assignments, you may be each others' readers. Comments from fellow students can be very useful.

# Writing groups 
The writing of longer assignments and theses requires a steady work process. To keep the process going, inviting readers can be very helpful. Commitments are helpful for keeping deadlines, and in addition your will find out how your work communicates with a reader. As a member of a writing group, you can submit drafts, give and receive feedback and find support in a community of students. The writing group is a supplement, not a replacement for your supervisor. Ideally a writing group is a group of students from the same discpipline subject who are at different writing stages. If you already have a reading group that works well, use it!

The PhD students Kajsa Parding and Sandhya Tiwari at UiB have greatly enjoyed their writing group in the final phase of their doctoral work:
