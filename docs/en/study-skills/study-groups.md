# Study groups

Discussing texts with others is a good way to engage actively with a text. You are likely to read more attentively if you are planning to discuss the text. Discussions also let you practise applying concepts and articulating arguments.

Efficient groupwork needs planning: Decide on what to discuss and who should be responsible for the different tasks. By taking turns, all group members will practice oral skills such as presenting, explaining and commenting relevant material. Even though unstructured group work can also be rewarding, they are less likely to edure in the long run. 

Forming a group early in your studies will give you a kickstart. You may begin to read and discuss course readings. Later on, when you start writing assignments, you may be each others' readers. Few things are more useful than to have readback from your peers.

#Writing groups 
Writing longer assignments and, e.g., master theses, requires a steady work process. To keep the process going, inviting readers can be very helpful. Commitments are helpful for keeping deadlines, and in addition your will find out how your work communicates with a reader. As a member of a writing group, you can submit drafts, give and receive feedback and find support in a community of students. The writing group is a supplement, not a replacement for your supervisor. Ideally a writing group is a group of students from the same discpipline subject who are at different writing stages. If you already have a reading group that works well, use it!

Plan in advance; agree on a topic and text (or texts) to discuss, and assign different texts or portions of text to different members of the group. Each person is responsible for presenting their material to the rest of the group. By taking turns, each group member will get practice in both explaining and commenting orally on academic material. It is also possible to have spontaneous discussion sessions, but the discussions in an unprepared study group are likely to degenerate into undirected “chat”.

The earlier you form a study group the better. Start with reading and discussing different assigned materials. Once you start writing, [read each other’s texts](/en/writing/the-writing-process/writing-groups/) instead. Comments from fellow students can be very useful.
