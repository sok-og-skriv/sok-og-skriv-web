# Searching

Information retrieval is a process that requires time and planning. New information must be compared with the knowledge we already have. In this way, we expand our knowledge and contribute to creating new meaning and understanding.

Before you start searching, think about:
•	What kind of information do you need for answering your research question?
•	How can you find this information?
•	How can you get an overview of existing theories and research in the field?

When writing an assignment, you will need different sources of information. All sources must be quality assessed. Hereunder we introduce some tools and inputs that you may find helpful.
