# How to do systematic searching
When you do a systematic search, it must be conducted according to a plan, well documented, and it must be verifiable. The latter means that if the search is repeated, it must yield the same result. Students are to an increasing degree expected to be able to perform systematic searches for research results. This is especially important when searching for literature for writing a review, or when the subject area in question places high value on knowledge based practice.

## Research question
An appropriate starting point for a systematic search is to formulate the question you want to find relevant literature to.

A research question will consist of two or more thematic elements. Before doing a systematic search, you should structure your research question and sort out the thematic elements. The transition to doing a search in a database or search engine will then be easier. Here are some help-questions that might guide you when sorting out the thematic elements:

* What is the **issue**/**problem**?
* Is any **intervention**/**measure**/**phenomenon** specified?
* What **population**/**group of people** is in question?
* Does the question include a special **setting**/**context**? 

Note that far from all research questions contain all these thematic elements.

::: eksempel Example
What do we know about the reasons for **school refusal** among **teenagers**?

The research question consists of the problem **school refusal** and the population **teenagers**, and these two are the thematic elements of this research question.
:::

The thematic elements makes the starting point for further planning of the search, where the next step will be [finding good search terms](internlenke)

:::::: details  The PICO and SPIDER frameworks are models used for structuring questions, often within health-related subjects, because it captures each key element required for a focused question. PICO stands for certain elements that are often included in health-related research questions:

**P**: (problem or patient) <br />
**I**: (intervention) <br />
**C**: (comparison) <br />
**O**: (outcome) <br />

PICO clarifies who or what your research question is about, what interventions are being scrutinized and what outcome you are interested in. 

**Application of PICO**

::::: eksempel Is exercise or diet most efficient for treating overweight?

:::: picoskjema
::: picoboks P
Overweight
:::

::: picoboks I
Excercise
:::

::: picoboks C
Diet
:::

::: picoboks O
Weight loss
:::
::::

In the example above, we are interested in the effect of the intervention "exercise" (I) in comparison to "diet" \(C\) . That is, we are looking to find studies that compare these two interventions. We want to measure the weight loss (O) of people who are overweight (P) .
:::::

It is not always appropriate to fill inn all the elements in the PICO table. Sometimes there are no clear I (intervention), C (comparison) is not specified, or no clear O (outcome) is expressed in the research question.

::::: eksempel PICO table with synonym suggestions

Below you see a PICO table where suggested synonyms are filled in for the research question "is exercise or training most efficient to treat overweight?"

Explanation:

mp = searching for textwords in the following fields of the reference: title, abstract, original title, name of substance word, subject heading word, floating sub-heading word, keyword heading word, organism supplementary concept word, protocol supplementary concept word, rare disease supplementary concept word, unique identifier, synonyms

**/** = the search term is fetched from the MeSH thesaurus.

**adj2** = finds terms in any order with 1 word (or none) between them. ADJ1 finds the two terms in any order, with no words between them.

**exp** = shows that narrower terms in the thesaurus are included.
::::::

## Search terms
Use the thematic elements to set up a search table that give an overview of the thematic elements and their search terms. In that way you ensure that all the elements are included in your search, at the same time not depending on which terms are used to describe the thematic elements.

| School refusal                | Teenagers         |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |     
|school refusal                 |teenagers          |
|school avoidance               |adolescents        |
|school phobia                  |youth              |
|self exclusion from school     |secondary school   |

## Combining search terms in the database search history

Most academic databases provide an overview of your search history. The search history shows which subject terms and textwords you have searched for, how they are combined, and how many hits each search has returned. The search process becomes flexible and evident if you choose to search for one word at the time, and then combine them in the search history using AND, OR or NOT.


::: eksempel Example: Systematic search presented via the search history in Web of Science


|Search#| Date       | Search term//combination                                                                                   | Results      |
| ----- | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1     | 24/03/2022 | "school refus*" OR school avoid*" OR "school phobia" OR "self exclusion from school" (Topic)               | 955          |

Topic = search for textwords in the following fields of the reference: Title, abstract, author keyword and keywords plus

## Reviewing the search result
A review of the results list can give you new insights, and maybe even lead you to change your original research question. A very long results list can reveal that the research question is too broad, and that it should be narrowed to become more precise. In these cases the search strategy must be set up again, and the search must be adjusted accordingly. Using our research question as an example; let us say that our results list implies that a common reason for school avoidance are psychological problems, such as anxiety. Then it might be an idea to narrow the research question by illuminating anxiety as reason for school avoidance, and further examine what interventions that exists for this population of students. This is how a reviewing the results list can lead to a narrowing or turning of the research question - or both, as our example shows. 

The databases also contain filters, so that you can limit your results list based on your needs. Examples of filters are: 

* Publication year
* Publication type (research articles, review articles, book chapters, conference proceedings etc.)
* Language
* Geographic area
* Age group
* Research method
* Subject area

::: warning Keep in mind that:
* Any limitation can lead to loosing important information.
* Every article's quality and relevance must be assessed according to your research question.
:::

## Saving your search

Most databases offer you the option to save your searches and send the search history via e-mail. The search history shows which subject terms and textwords you have searched for, how they are combined, and how many hits each search has returned. This information might turn out be very useful if you wish to build further on your search, if you need to rerun the same search at a later stage, run it in in another database or if you need to [document your search](internlenke).

## Documenting your search

Sometimes you must, after you have finished your systematic search, describe the search process thoroughly, so that the reader are able to evaluate the quality of the search you have done, and possibly repeat the same search at a later stage. When documenting your search you should include:

* What databases you have searched in.
* Which search terms you have used in the different databases and how they are combined (AND/OR/NOT)
* If you have used the database subject terms (thesaurus).
* If you have used some of the filters provided by the database.
* The date for when the search was done.

::: tip Tips
It is a good idea to save your search history when you have finished a search in a database, so that you can fetch it at a later stage, and possibly rerun the search. Also, the search history is the best documentation of your search. Remember to note down which databases you have searched in.
