The most important thing about reading is to actually _read_. People who read a lot on a regular basis will usually develop good reading skills automatically. Our top tip for anyone who needs to read for the purposes of their studies is simply this: get reading! There is no other way to become a good reader.

Learning a subject involves getting familiar with texts that communicate scholarly insights as well as information about research methods and current areas of debate. Of course, reading is not the only way to learn about a subject: you will also attend lectures, discuss and debate at seminars and study groups, and write research papers.

In this section you find some basic advice about reading strategies, as well as some suggestions to bear in mind. You can adopt a pick-and-choose approach to the following advice – the same strategies will not suit everyone.

The verb "to read" is linked etymologically to the verb "to pick". The Latin word _lego_ means "I pick", as well as "I collect" and "I read".

Happy reading!
