Everyday speech, personal views, small talk and strong characterisations should be avoided in academic texts. You may also find it helpful to omit adjectives and "filler words".Â 

### Vocabulary

A good rule is to stick to ordinary words that you are sure you understand. Although an examiner will often be able to guess what the student is trying to say, it is always better to express yourself precisely in the first place.

There are some common words that are often used wrongly. Sometimes words are used to convey the opposite of their actual meaning. The result may be unintentionally comical.
